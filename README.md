# SeatScore
Online attendance made easy

## Inspiration
With remote learning, teachers take a large amount of class time to take attendance. Teachers must ask students to answer questions in the chat, which can lead to inconvenience as all students may not reply. In some cases, teachers are even forced to make students unmute themselves and talk to take attendance. Precious learning time cannot be wasted for attendance purposes in class. The solution? **SeatScore**

## What it does
SeatScore is an innovative website that makes teachersâ€™ lives easier. All the teacher needs to do is upload a screenshot of the participants list. Our algorithm compares those present with the class roster and creates a list of absent students on that day.

## How we built it
We used Flask with Python, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. We used the open-source libraries OpenCV and Tesseract-OCR.
